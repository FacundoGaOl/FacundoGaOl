# About me

I´m a Junior Web Developer in training, currently studying at Factoría F5 where and trying to gain strong technical foundation in front-end web technologies and back-end development on the future through practical project and exercise.

My background in Graphic Design gives me a strong complement to the new technical knowledge I´m learning. I´m enjoying a lot learning about them and getting to know new ways to solve problems.

I want to document  my learning journey here and improve every day learning new things.
